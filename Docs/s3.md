## AWS SSE-C Deprecation (April 2026)

**Important Change:**
- SSE-C (customer-provided keys) disabled by default for new buckets
- Existing buckets without SSE-C data will have SSE-C disabled
- Applications requiring SSE-C must explicitly enable via API

**Impact on InfraGuard:**
- Current encryption check (`check_s3_encryption`) unaffected
- Detects presence/absence of encryption, not specific type
- SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS remain default options

**Recommendation:**
- Default to SSE-S3 (AES256) or SSE-KMS
- Only use SSE-C if you manage your own encryption keys


S3 Object Lock provides WORM (Write Once Read Many) protection to prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed time or indefinitely. It's crucial for:

Security Benefits:

Ransomware protection - attackers can't delete/encrypt backups
Compliance - SEC 17a-4, FINRA, HIPAA requirements
Audit trail immutability - CloudTrail logs can't be tampered with
Insider threat mitigation - prevents malicious deletion
Why it matters for InfraGuard:
For DevOps/security teams, detecting buckets storing critical data (logs, backups, compliance records) WITHOUT Object Lock is a security gap.
